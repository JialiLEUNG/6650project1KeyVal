/**
 * ClientTCP implements a client by establishing a socket connection and communication.
 * The client connects to TCP port 32000, writes a line of text,
 * and then reads the echoed text back from the server.
 * This client will detect network timeouts, and exit gracefully, rather than stalling.
 *
 * Start client and the run by typing "java ClientTCP.java localhost 32000".
 *
 * The following steps are applied for the client's communication with the server:
 * 1. The client initiates connection to a server specified by hostname/IP address and port number.
 * 2. Send data to the server using an OutputStream.
 * 3. Read data from the server using an InputStream.
 * 4. Close the connection.
 *
 * The current client runs on a file that is named as ClientRequestTCP.txt, the path is hard coded
 * so that once the key-value store is populated, the client can do at least five of each operation: 5 PUTs, 5 GETs, 5 DELETEs.
 * The final command is "Exit" which is to exit the program.
